## Mission Statement
Bonito promotes cultural diversity through sharing culinary knowledge and experience.
We want to encourage Seattle-area home cooks to broaden their culinary horizons by
increasing visibility and access to hard-to-find ingredients.

## Problem Statement
Thanks to easily accessible online cookbooks, home cooks from all around the country are able to quickly and efficiently explore recipes for foods that they've never tried before. However, a consequence of having all of these different recipes online is that cooks will see an interesting recipe for a meal from a different culture, but that recipe will contain numerous different ingredients that are obscure and or hard to obtain. One example of this problem is that if one tries to search for a recipe for Bobotie, a South African dish, an essential ingrediant to it is Asafoetida. Asafoetida is a plant native to Iran and Afghanistan, and it is fairly hard to even recognize, let alone buy in a store in Seattle. Perhaps someone from South Africa would recognize it and know where to buy it, but other people who are seeking to appreciate South African food and cook it in their own homes would have no idea where to get it. There is no current solution to this problem beyond asking someone via word-of-mouth and hoping that they would know where to buy it.
