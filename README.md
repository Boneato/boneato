## Mission Statement
Bonito promotes cultural diversity through sharing culinary knowledge and experience.
We want to encourage Seattle-area home cooks to broaden their culinary horizons by
increasing visibility and access to hard-to-find ingredients.

## Problem Statement
Thanks to easily accessible online cookbooks, home cooks from all around the country are able to quickly and efficiently explore recipes for foods that they've never tried before. However, a consequence of all of these different recipes online is that cooks will see an interesting recipe for a meal from a different culture, but that recipe will contain obscure and hard to obtain ingredients. One example is if one tries to search for a recipe for Bobotie, a South African dish, an essential ingrediant to it is Asafoetida. Asafoetida is a plant native to Iran and Afghanistan that it is fairly hard to recognize; let alone buy in a store in Seattle. Perhaps someone from South Africa would recognize it and know where to buy it, but other people who are seeking to appreciate South African food and cook it in their own homes would be lost. In our user research conducted among university students in the greater Seattle area, a majority 90% of participants cooked at home. Out of this majority, 58% of participants cooked food from outside of their culture 3-6+ times a month. Most of these amatuer cooks used Google as a resource to find obscure ingredients, while a second majority asked friends. Doing a quick google search of where to buy Asafoetida in Seattle returns some locations, a couple of moderately related articles, and some reddit posts. The same results appear for most obscure ingredients. Although some locations might appear in the search results, there is no guarantee that those locations will have the exact ingredients. This can leave many users unsure as to where to buy the necessary ingredients. This barrier might be a big enough of an annoyance to deter amatuer chefs from creating and experiencing other cultural cusines. As of now, there is no directly current solution that fixes this issue of uncertainty.
